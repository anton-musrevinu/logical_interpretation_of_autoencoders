# Scala-LearnPsdd
Learning the Structure of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams. https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yliang/papers/uai2017.pdf

This repository contains the latest stable version of the LearnPSDD code and all the experiments we run for the paper "Learning the Structure of Probabilistic Sentential Decision Diagrams" published in UAI, 2017.

Code can be compiled by running "sbt assembly". The code would create a psdd.jar in the directory target/scala-2.11 Experiments can be reproduced by running "java -jar target/scala-2.11/psdd.jar ". 

We provide manual.pdf as a walkthrough of this library. 

All these 20 datasets can be found on https://github.com/UCLA-StarAI/Density-Estimation-Datasets
