Experimen Flow:

1 - learn encoder decoder functions 													[DONE]

2 - convert dataset																		[DONE]

3 - learn vtree on converted training set												[DONE]		

4 - compile hard constraintes (discrete variables, and onehot) with learnend vtree to sdd to psdd [DONE]

5 - compile sdd to hard-contrained-PSDD													[DONE]

6 - learn psdd with existing vtree and hard-contrained-PSDD

7 - analyse psdd with test set
